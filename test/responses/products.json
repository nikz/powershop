Only The Green Power Company buys carbon credits to help offset the greenhouse gas emissions from electricity generated on your behalf. \u003C/b\u003E\r\n\r\nThe sources of electricity on the grid range from the giant Manapouri and other hydro dams, geothermal power at Wairakei, through to gas and coal fired power, including the thermal power station at Huntly. Around one third of electricity in NZ is generated from fossil fueled thermal power stations. \u003Ca href=\"http://www.med.govt.nz/upload/63349/GHG%20Report.pdf\"\u003ESource MED\u003C/a\u003E Even the geothermal fields in Wairakei are not above reproach, as they result in so called fugitive greenhouse gas emissions. Every household in New Zealand that is on the grid relies on all of these power stations, although the mix of electricity source you use depends on where you live and changes through the seasons.\r\n\r\nEach of these power sources has a different contribution to New Zealand\u2019s carbon emissions, with established hydro dams showing essentially zero emissions and coal and gas fired plants the most.  The MED release quarterly updates on the electricity generation emission factor and it is this emission factor  we use in our calculations to determine the amount of carbon we need to offset for each unit of Green Power you purchase (see  \u003Ca href=\"http://www.med.govt.nz/upload/67175/NZEQ_Sepetmber08_EditorsVersion.pdf\"\u003Ehttp://www.med.govt.nz/upload/67175/NZEQ_Sepetmber08_EditorsVersion.pdf\u003C/a\u003E).  Currently, the emissions factor to determine the greenhouse gas equivalent of electricity derived emissions from generation is 0.18 (ktCO2e/GWh).\r\n\r\nThe greenhouse gas emissions per electricity unit are therefore 0.18kg/unit. For every Green Power unit you purchase The Green Power Company will purchase verified \u003Ca href=\"http://www.v-c-s.org/projects.html\"\u003Evoluntary carbon units\u003C/a\u003E to offset 0.18kg of carbon.  As voluntary carbon units offset carbon by the tonne and individual household electricity emissions per month are likely to be in kilograms of carbon, we will aggregate the emissions from all our customers and reconcile them the month following to the nearest tonne. Aggregated emissions that are less than one tonne will be rolled over to the following month.\r\n\r\nThe verified voluntary carbon units purchased by us will be retired in our Voluntary Carbon Standard Registry account.

They work directly with rural communities in countries and locations that need serious help to restore ecological balance.\r\n\r\nPlanting the trees helps the communities in three ways - restoring degrading lands and farms, minimising erosion, and providing forage for animals. The process also involves training local people to care for their own environment. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile Trees for the Future estimates that each tree will absorb about 50 lb (that's 22 kg) of carbon, though this is not certified, and it will vary depending on the type of tree and the location.
